## Store Manager - Shopping Center

Project Description :
This project was developed as the final challenge for the Laboratory I course. It is a store management system for a Shopping Center, which uses several fundamental Java programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and array manipulation.

The system manages the stores in the shopping center, including their products, addresses, foundation dates, and also allows modifications, report generation, and other features.

Features and Challenge Stages
Stage 1: Class Creation
Development of the basic classes: Loja (Store), Produto (Product), Endereco (Address), and Data (Date).

Implementation of attributes, constructors, getters, setters, and specific methods such as toString, salary expenses calculation, and date validation.

Stage 2: Class Association
Updating classes for associations between them (e.g., Loja with Endereco and Data).

Implementation of a menu for creating stores and products via user input.

Expired products check.

Stage 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism
Creation of Loja subclasses for different store types: Cosmetico (Cosmetics), Vestuario (Clothing), Bijuteria (Jewelry), Alimentacao (Food), and Informatica (IT).

Implementation of specific attributes for each subclass and overriding the toString method.

Stage 4: Arrays
Use of arrays to manage product stock in each store and to manage the stores in the shopping center.

Methods for inserting, removing, and listing products and stores.

Implementation of specific features such as counting stores by type and identifying the IT store with the most expensive insurance.

Technologies Used
Language: Java
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Version Control: Git and GitHub
